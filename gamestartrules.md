Understanding where to put the disc into play after it falls to the ground is crucial for smooth gameplay in Ultimate Frisbee. Below is a detailed guide covering various scenarios you might encounter during a match.

### **Field Layout Overview**

- **Playing Field Proper**: Rectangular area measuring 70 yards long and 40 yards wide.
- **End Zones**: Two end zones at each end of the field, each 25 yards deep.
- **Brick Mark**: A spot 20 yards upfield from the end zone and centered on the field.

### **General Principles**

- **Out-of-Bounds (OOB)**: Any area outside the playing field proper.
- **Pivot Point**: Spot where the thrower establishes a pivot foot to resume play.

## **Scenarios and Disc Placement**

### **1. Pull Goes Out of Bounds Without Touching In-Bounds**

- **Scenario**: The defensive team pulls the disc, and it sails out of bounds without touching the playing field.
- **Options for the Receiving Team**:
  - **Brick Mark**:
    - **Procedure**: Signal by raising one hand overhead and calling "brick" before touching the disc.
    - **Disc Placement**: Bring the disc to the brick mark and establish a pivot foot there.
  - **Sideline Nearest to OOB Point**:
    - **Procedure**: Retrieve the disc and walk it to the sideline closest to where it went out.
    - **Disc Placement**: Establish a pivot foot at that sideline spot.

### **2. Pull Lands In-Bounds and Rolls Out of Bounds**

- **Scenario**: The pull touches the playing field and then rolls out of bounds.

### **3. Pull Lands In the End Zone and Stays There**

- **Scenario**: The pull lands and stays in your end zone without being touched.

- **Disc Placement**:
  - **Goal Line**: The opposing team brings the disc to the front end zone line (goal line) perpendicular to where it went out and establishes a pivot foot there.

### **9. Stall Count Violation**

- **Scenario**: The thrower fails to release the disc before the defender's stall count reaches ten.
- **Disc Placement**:
  - **Spot of Stall**: The opposing team takes possession at the spot where the stall occurred.

### **12. Time-Outs and Equipment Time-Outs**

- **Scenario**: A team calls a time-out.
